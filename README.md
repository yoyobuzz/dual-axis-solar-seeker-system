## Introduction

This project addresses the increasing need for efficient solar energy systems, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. India, with its abundance of solar energy, has set ambitious renewable energy targets, including 280 GW from solar power by 2030. This project presents a laboratory-scale model of a solar tracking system, which can significantly improve the efficiency of solar power systems by tracking the sun's movement throughout the day and across seasons.

## Procedure

### Initial Research

The decision to use a dual-axis tracking system was made to account for both daily and seasonal variations in the sun's position. The system employs two servo motors to adjust the panel's azimuth and elevation angles based on light sensor readings.

### Block Diagram

The system uses two light sensors to measure light intensity at different points on the solar panel. The microcontroller calculates the error between these readings and adjusts the panel's position to minimize this error using a proportional controller.

### 3D Modelling and Circuit Design

The prototype was modelled using Fusion 360 and constructed with 3D-printed and laser-cut parts. The circuit diagram was designed to control the servo motors based on the LDR sensor inputs.

### Software Programming

An Arduino-based program was developed to control the servos' movement based on the sensor readings. The system continuously monitors light intensity and adjusts the panel's position in small increments to maximize solar exposure.

## Conclusion

The dual-axis solar tracking system significantly improves the efficiency of solar panels, increasing energy generation by an average of 32% compared to fixed PV arrays. The system operates efficiently, consuming minimal power to control the servos.

## Limitations

1. **Dispersed Light Detection**:  
   The system relies on accurate light detection by LDRs, which can struggle in conditions with diffuse or dispersed light, leading to inaccurate tracking.
   
2. **Discrete Motor Actuation**:  
   The use of servo motors, which operate in discrete steps, limits the precision of the panel's movement compared to systems using continuous DC motors.

## Future Goals

Future improvements could include integrating a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm to further optimize the systemâ€™s energy efficiency. By dynamically adjusting the system's operating point based on real-time environmental conditions, MPPT could help to maximize energy generation in large-scale solar systems.
